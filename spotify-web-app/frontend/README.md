# Spotify Web App - Frontend

This is the frontend part of the Spotify Web App, built using React. It interacts with the Spotify API to provide a seamless music experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd spotify-web-app/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   Start the development server with:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will launch the app in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
